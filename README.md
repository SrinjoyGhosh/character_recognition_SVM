# character_recognition_SVM

just screwing around

This project is a naive impementation of SVM to detect characters from a sample image
To run the project get a sample image with characters written on it
Run project.py and create a dump file
Run project_test.py to get the output
The output shows the top 3 predictions for each characters in the sample input image

Note: Do install cv2 and the corresponding dependencies and change the path to dope folder containing the dataset before you run
      project.py
